All I wanted was a little peace and an easy life...

Life is a boring trail... Apathy is just what I'm used to...

What happened to me? I guess I'm just an idiot and I'm mentally broken.

Gaming? Anime? Movie? Are those supposed to help me relieve stress? 

I just don't know what I'm doing anymore, I don't feel anything to anything I do now... 

I'm just an empty depressed shell.
